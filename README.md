# ATON performance profiler plugin

This plugin allows to track, record and generate reports (CSV) about real-time performances. Requires url parameter `rdur=<duration_in_seconds>` to start, e.g.: `?rdur=10`

## Getting started

1) Follow [ATON framework instructions](https://github.com/phoenixbf/aton)
2) Just git clone or place "perfpro" folder inside `/Your-ATON-folder/public/custom/plugins/` thus obtaining: `/Your-ATON-folder/public/custom/plugins/perfpro/`
3) When loading a 3D scene with Hathor, you can start tracking performances and downloading CSV reports
